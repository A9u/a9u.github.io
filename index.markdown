<h2> Projects 📂 </h2>
Some of my projects which I am proud of are:-
  1. [No-Q](https://github.com/A9u/no-q-ui)

      Idea: This was my Hackathon project at my previous company. It is a platform that makes day-to-day shopping easy while following social distancing. The user can book a slot for shopping in stores registered on the NoQ platform. On successful booking, the user will receive an e-Token which can be presented at the store on a visit. The platform ensures the bookings do not exceed given capacity by store owner so users can enjoy their little trip to the store with safety.

      Tech Stack: React, Rails, Postgres

  2. [Urja](https://github.com/A9u/urja)

      Idea: It is a general purpose Go wrapper over Mac's pmset command.

      Tech Stack: Go

  3. [Altilia](https://github.com/A9u/altilia)

      Idea: It is an application which will notify the users when their laptop is completely charged. It is an ongoing project and currently supports only Mac.

      Tech Stack: Go

  4. [con-currency](https://github.com/A9u/con-currency)

      Idea: It is a go package for fetching currency rates using XE service.

      Tech Stack: Go
